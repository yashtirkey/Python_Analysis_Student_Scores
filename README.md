# Python_Analysis_Student_Scores

This project analyzes student performance across different groups based on a dataset containing scores and demographic information. The project includes the following key steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and cleaned to prepare it for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts are created to explore the distribution of scores among different ethnic groups and other relevant factors.

3. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics are calculated to understand the central tendencies and dispersions of the data.

4. Group Comparisons: Comparisons are made between different groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity) to investigate their performance across different metrics.

Conclusion: The analysis concludes with a summary of findings based on the visual and statistical outputs.

This notebook makes use of popular Python libraries such as ### pandas , ### matplotlib , and ### seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
